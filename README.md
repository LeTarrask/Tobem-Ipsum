# Tobem Ipsum

A simple Lorem Ipsun generator in your Status Bar for Mac OS written in SwiftUI.

The first dictionary uses the words from [Jessier Quirino's sketch Matuto doente das partes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UunT1yZPUxs) poem-sketch.

The second dictionary uses some words from [Monty Python's Dead Parrot Sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubVBK3cKanw), and other synonyms for dead.
